# Integrating Bazel with IDEs

Bazel currently integrates with the following IDEs via third-party solutions:

*  Android Studio

*  CLion

*  IntelliJ

*  Xcode

## IDE plug-ins

[Plug-ins](http://ij.bazel.build) for Android Studio, CLion, and IntelliJ
enable you to:

*  Import BUILD files into the IDE

*  Make your IDE aware of Bazel's build and Skylark languages

*  Build, test, and execute binaries directly from the IDE

## Tulsi

[Tulsi](http://tulsi.bazel.build) generates Bazel-compatible Xcode projects from
Bazel's `BUILD` files.
